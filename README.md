Hi!

My name is Antonio. I live in Milan, Italy. 
I study engineering of computing systems at Politecnico di milano. 

I love programming for 2 reasons:
- by programming I can create "stuff" and this makes me feel powerful :)
- programming lets me communicate with a "non-living" thing and tell it what I want it to do fr me!

I also play the guitar and I sail.

- C/C++
